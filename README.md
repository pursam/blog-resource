## In this project, I tested my skills on the task:
- Create a blog resource
- interface be made up of individual components

- Use React in combination with Typescript

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# To see the deployment of the project, you can use this link to netlify hosting [https://pursam-replica-blog.netlify.app](https://pursam-replica-blog.netlify.app)

Or

# You will need to have node.js installed, run the console in the root of the repository and enter these commands in turn:

`npm init` - will download all dependent components
`npm start` - will start the project in developer demo mode,
all changes in the code will be applied to the dynamically updated page [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
